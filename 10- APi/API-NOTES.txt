API Endpoints:

An API endpoint is the specific URL or location where an API can be accessed.
It represents a resource or a specific piece of functionality that the API provides.
Each endpoint typically corresponds to a specific HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and a unique URL path.
Examples of API endpoints: /users, /products, /orders, /login, etc.


Query Parameters:

Query parameters are additional pieces of information that can be appended to the end of an API endpoint's URL.
They are used to provide additional context or filters to the API request.
Query parameters are typically represented as key-value pairs, separated by an equal sign (=) and joined with an ampersand (&).
Examples of query parameters: ?limit=10&offset=20&sortBy=name, ?search=apple&category=electronics.


Path Parameters:

Path parameters are dynamic parts of the API endpoint's URL that represent specific resources or entities.
They are used to specify a unique identifier or a specific instance of a resource within the API.
Path parameters are typically denoted by a placeholder, such as a variable name enclosed in curly braces: /users/{userId}, /products/{productId}.
When making an API request, the actual values for the path parameters are substituted in the URL.
